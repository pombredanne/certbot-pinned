# certbot-pinned
A metadata-only Python package to install cerbot that is safely 
pip-installable using pinned dependencies

The versions are the same as certbot's and all the dependencies are
pinned strictly to avoid possible issues such as https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/5015

Use at your own risks.
